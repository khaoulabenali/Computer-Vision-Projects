### What is a MediaPipe?
- MediaPipe is a Framework for building machine learning pipelines for processing time-series data like video, audio, etc. This cross-platform Framework works in Desktop/Server, Android, iOS, and embedded devices like Raspberry Pi and Jetson Nano.
- MediaPipe powers revolutionary products and services we use daily. Unlike power-hungry machine learning Frameworks, MediaPipe requires minimal resources. It is so tiny and efficient that even embedded IoT devices can run it. In 2019, MediaPipe opened up a whole new world of opportunity for researchers and developers following its public release. 

### Graphs:
-The MediaPipe perception pipeline is called a Graph. Let us take the example of the first solution, Hands. We feed a stream of images as input which comes out with hand landmarks rendered on the images.
